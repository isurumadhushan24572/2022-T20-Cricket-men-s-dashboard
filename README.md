### Introduction

Our project centres around cricket, a globally popular sport. We specifically focus on analysing
the T20 cricket format, emphasizing the 2022 T20 World Cup. This choice stems from a 
comprehensive study of cricket's landscape and the distinctive features of T20 tournaments.

#### Introduction of data set

The dataset obtained from Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of cricket statistics, capturing 
individual player performances during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022, hosted in Australia. 
Comprising two distinct files, "batting_card.csv" and "bowling_card.csv," the dataset offers a 
granular insight into the dynamic world of T20 cricket.
